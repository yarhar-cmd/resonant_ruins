          <p>
            Assessment rooms record simple local signals: pace, damage, attacks, defensive actions,
            route choice, and appetite for optional risk.

          <h2>Interpret</h2>
          <p>
            The prototype translates those signals into plain playstyle weights. It does not
            diagnose skill or personality.

          <p>
            Adaptive rooms alter encounter density, puzzle emphasis, and reward placement without
            changing player physics.
